error during build:
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] [plugin vite-plugin-pwa:build] index.html?html-proxy&inline-css&index=0.css (undefined:NaN): There was an error during the build:
  [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
Additionally, handling the error in the 'buildEnd' hook caused the following error:
